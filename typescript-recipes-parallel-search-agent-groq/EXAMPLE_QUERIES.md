## Tips for Writing Effective Queries

### ✅ DO Include:
- Season (FW25, SS25)
- Price range ($X-$Y)
- Specific materials (leather, wool, silk)
- Style descriptors (oversized, tailored, minimalist)
- Region/market (EU, US)
- Condition (new, vintage, resale)

### ❌ DON'T:
- Be too vague ("nice dresses")
- Use brand names without additional context
- Forget price ranges for buying queries
- Omit size/fit requirements for client orders

### 💡 Power User Tips:
1. **Combine presets with queries**: Use Retail + EU Retail presets for comprehensive European luxury coverage
2. **Start broad, then narrow**: If results are too limited, remove domain filters and try again
3. **Use "authenticated" for resale**: Helps filter for legitimate luxury resale platforms
4. **Mention "in stock" or "available now"**: Prioritizes current inventory over pre-orders
5. **Include "shipping" details**: Especially important for international buyers
